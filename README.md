# Conversational BI Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic Conversational Business Intelligence system. Users can query a CSV dataset using natural language.

## Features
- Load a CSV file containing business data.
- Process natural language queries to calculate averages, maximums, etc.
- Sample queries:
  - What is the average of column "Sales"?
  - Show the maximum value in column "Quantity".

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas

## How to Run
1. Place your dataset as `sample_data.csv` in the same directory as `main.py`.
2. Run the script using: `python main.py`.
3. Enter queries as prompted.

## Future Work
- Multilingual support (e.g., Sinhala).
- Dynamic dashboard visualization.
